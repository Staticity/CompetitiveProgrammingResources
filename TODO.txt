have:
fast dijkstra (tested, used in real problem)
disjoint set (tested, tested by proxy w/ kruskals)
segment tree (tested)
segment tree with updates (tested)
max flow - ford fulkerson (tested, used in real problem)
topo sort - (tested, need to test on ordering tasks)
prims - (tested, tested on real problem)
kruskals - (tested, tested on real problem)

still need:
hungarian algorithm
suffix stuff

any math stuff? computational geometry, etc..

RMQ (not segment tree)

fenwick tree/BIT

trie?

anything else?
