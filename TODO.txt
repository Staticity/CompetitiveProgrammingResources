have:
fast dijkstra (tested, used in real problem)
disjoint set (tested)
segment tree (tested)
segment tree with updates (tested)
max flow - ford fulkerson (tested, used in real problem)

still need:
prims
kruskals (w/ above disjoint set)
hungarian algorithm
suffix stuff

any math stuff? computational geometry, etc..

RMQ (not segment tree)

fenwick tree/BIT

trie?

anything else?
